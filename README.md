* [Chinese Clinical Terminology Standardization Task](https://github.com/omigeft/Chinese-Clinical-Terminology-Standardization-Task) (Python PyTorch): Implementing CHIP2021-Task 3 Chinese clinical terminology standardization task based on LLM, with an accuracy rate of approximately 70%.

* [RVSC Medical Image Segmentation](https://github.com/omigeft/RVSC-Medical-Image-Segmentation) (Python, PyTorch): Multiple approaches for completing RVSC (Right Ventricle Segmentation Challenge), including PyTorch implementations of UNet with attention, UNet++, U2Net.

* [EterPlan](https://github.com/omigeft/eterplan) (JavaScript, WeChat mimiprogram): WeChat miniprogram EterPlan is a miniprogram that uses Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve intelligence to help users learn, memorize, memorize, review, and other subjects that require a lot of memory. Developed using WeChat Cloud.

I also have some more projects under development.
